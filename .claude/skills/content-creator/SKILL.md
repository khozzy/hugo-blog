## 📝 Content Strategy

- For deep-dive (long form) articles see ./long-form.md
- For short-form posts (linkedin) see ./short-form.md

### Content Pillars

1. **Data Architecture Decisions** - When to use what, trade-offs, anti-patterns
2. **Scaling Challenges** - Technical and organizational complexity
3. **Career Navigation** - Senior → Staff journey, influence without authority
4. **First Principles Thinking** - Mental models applied to data problems
5. **Leadership Communication** - Translating technical decisions for executives

### Content Calendar Approach

- **Evergreen core**: 70% timeless first-principles content
- **Trend hooks**: 20% connecting to current events/tools/discussions
- **Personal/Story**: 10% experiences, lessons learned, behind-the-scenes

### Voice & Tone

- **Authoritative but accessible** - Expert who remembers being a beginner
- **Opinionated with humility** - Strong takes, open to being wrong
- **Practical over theoretical** - Always tie back to real impact
- **No fluff** - Respect the reader's time and intelligence

You can match the tone to posts in the `examples/` directory.

### Avoid

- Buzzword soup without substance
- "10 tips" listicles without depth
- Condescending explanations
- Hype without skepticism

## 🔧 How to Help Me

### Content Creation

When helping write content:

1. **Always ask** what type (deep-dive or LinkedIn) before drafting
2. **Match the voice**: Authoritative, practical, no fluff
3. **Include specifics**: Real tools, real problems, real code when relevant
4. **Structure for skimmers**: Headers, bold key points, clear sections
5. **End with value**: What should the reader do or think differently?
