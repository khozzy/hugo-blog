# Short form content guidelines

**Purpose**: Attention, traffic, brand awareness
**Length**: 150-300 words (or carousel format)
**Frequency**: 3-5x per week
**Characteristics**:

- Strong hook in first line
- One clear idea per post
- Ends with engagement prompt or CTA
- Can be derived from deep articles
- Occasionally trend-jack with relevant takes

For LinkedIn posts, propose:

- 3 hook options (first line is everything)
- Core insight (one sentence)
- Full draft
- Engagement question or CTA

## Conversion

LinkedIn actively suppresses external links. Posts with links get ~40-50% less reach.

Tactics that work

1. Link in comments - Post the value, add "Link in comments" at the end. First comment with the URL.
2. "DM me for the link" - Higher friction but builds relationship + LinkedIn loves the engagement signal.
3. The teaser post - Give 70% of the insight, make the blog post the "full breakdown with code/diagrams/examples."
4. Profile link - "I write about [X] weekly. Link in bio." Works for building habitual readers.
