# CTA Copy Formulas

## Headline Patterns

### Value-First (Recommended)
Focus on what they get, not what they do.

```
Get the [Specific Deliverable]
```

**Examples**:
- "Get the SQL Cheat Sheet"
- "Get the Algorithm Selection Framework"
- "Get the Migration Checklist"

### Action-Outcome
What they'll be able to do after.

```
[Verb] [Outcome] [Faster/Better/Easier]
```

**Examples**:
- "Ship Temporal Joins Faster"
- "Choose the Right Algorithm Every Time"
- "Never Rewrite These Patterns Again"

### Problem-Solution
Address the pain directly.

```
Stop [Pain Point]
```

**Examples**:
- "Stop Rewriting the Same SQL"
- "Stop Guessing Which Algorithm"
- "Stop Debugging Event Sequences Manually"

### Curiosity Gap
Works for extended content.

```
The [Number] [Things] I Didn't Include
```

**Examples**:
- "The 3 Edge Cases I Didn't Cover"
- "The Production Gotchas I Left Out"

## Description Patterns

### Specificity Formula
Be concrete about format, scope, coverage.

```
[Format] + [Scope] + [Benefit/Use case]
```

**Examples**:
- "One-page PDF with all 12 temporal join patterns. Print it, bookmark it, share with your team."
- "Copy-paste SQL for BigQuery, Snowflake, DuckDB, and Redshift. Ready for production."
- "Decision tree for Thompson Sampling vs UCB vs Epsilon-Greedy, with trade-offs explained."

### Social Proof Lite
Reference the content's utility.

```
[What it contains] + [How others use it]
```

**Examples**:
- "The same cheatsheet I keep open during code reviews."
- "The framework I use for every A/B test design."

### Time Saved
Quantify the value.

```
[Time investment] → [Time saved]
```

**Examples**:
- "5-minute read → hours of documentation hunting saved."
- "One page → no more context-switching to docs."

## Button Text

### Direct (Default)
- "Subscribe" - Generic, lowest friction
- "Send it" - Casual, implies delivery
- "Get it" - Action-oriented

### Specific (Higher conversion)
- "Get the Cheatsheet"
- "Send the Bundle"
- "Get the Framework"

### Urgency (Use sparingly)
- "Get Instant Access"
- "Download Now"

## Complete CTA Examples

### Reference Card Pattern
```
headline: "Get the SQL Cheat Sheet"
description: "All 12 temporal join patterns as copy-paste SQL for BigQuery, Snowflake, DuckDB, and Redshift. Print it, bookmark it, share it with your team."
button: "Send it"
```

### Implementation Kit Pattern
```
headline: "Get the Code + Decision Framework"
description: "The Google Colab notebook with all simulations, plus the algorithm selection guide for your next project."
button: "Get the Bundle"
```

### Checklist Pattern
```
headline: "Get the Migration Checklist"
description: "12 steps from legacy schema to Activity Schema. Check them off as you go."
button: "Send it"
```

### Extended Content Pattern
```
headline: "Get the Full Analysis"
description: "The 3 edge cases and production gotchas I cut for readability. Real incidents, real solutions."
button: "Send it"
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Too vague**:
- "Want more?" - More what?
- "Subscribe for updates" - What updates?
- "Join the newsletter" - Why?

**Too salesy**:
- "Unlock exclusive content!"
- "Don't miss out!"
- "Limited time offer!"

**Mismatched value**:
- Promising "comprehensive guide" for a one-pager
- "Master X" for a cheatsheet
- Overpromising on what's delivered

## Persona Alignment

For "The Stuck Senior" persona:

**Resonates**:
- Frameworks for decision-making
- Vocabulary for explaining to leadership
- Time-saving references
- "Staff/Principal-level" positioning

**Avoid**:
- Beginner-oriented language
- Basic tutorials they already know
- Hype without substance

**Good angles**:
- "The framework for articulating this to your VP"
- "Reference card for code reviews"
- "Decision matrix for architecture discussions"
