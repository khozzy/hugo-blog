# Lead Magnet & Incentive Patterns

## Content Gating Strategies

### 1. The Bonus Section

Strip a valuable section from the post and offer it as signup bonus.

**Best for**: Posts with distinct, separable valuable sections
**Implementation**: Remove section, add CTA where it was

**Examples**:

- "Advanced configuration options" → "Get the Advanced Config Guide"
- "Performance benchmarks" → "Get the Full Benchmark Report"
- "Edge cases and gotchas" → "Get the Edge Cases Cheatsheet"

### 2. The Reference Card

Distill the post's core framework into a one-page printable reference.

**Best for**: Posts teaching mental models, frameworks, or multi-step processes
**Implementation**: Keep full post, offer condensed version

**Examples**:

- Thompson Sampling post → "Algorithm Selection Decision Tree"
- Activity Schema post → "12 Temporal Join Patterns SQL Cheatsheet"
- Architecture post → "Architecture Decision Record Template"

### 3. The Implementation Kit

Bundle code, templates, or configs that make applying the post's ideas easier.

**Best for**: Technical tutorials, how-to posts
**Implementation**: Link to code in post, offer expanded bundle

**Examples**:

- Code snippets → "Copy-Paste Starter Kit for [4 Warehouses]"
- Config examples → "Production-Ready Config Templates"
- SQL patterns → "SQL Snippet Library for Your Warehouse"

### 4. The Extended Examples

Keep post focused, offer additional examples/case studies.

**Best for**: Concept posts that benefit from varied applications
**Implementation**: Show 1-2 examples in post, offer more

**Examples**:

- "3 more industry-specific applications"
- "Real production incidents with analysis"
- "Before/after refactoring examples"

### 5. The Checklist

Convert procedural content into actionable checklist format.

**Best for**: Posts about processes, migrations, reviews
**Implementation**: Narrative in post, checklist as bonus

**Examples**:

- Migration guide → "12-Step Migration Checklist"
- Code review tips → "Code Review Checklist PDF"
- Setup tutorial → "Environment Setup Checklist"

### 6. The Comparison Matrix

Create decision matrix comparing options discussed.

**Best for**: Posts comparing tools, approaches, or tradeoffs
**Implementation**: Discussion in post, structured matrix as bonus

**Examples**:

- Tool comparison → "Feature Comparison Matrix"
- Architecture patterns → "Pattern Selection Matrix"
- Cloud services → "Cost/Feature Comparison Spreadsheet"

## Incentive Value Hierarchy

From lowest to highest perceived value:

1. **Summary/TLDR** - Low value, readers can skim
2. **PDF of the post** - Low value, they already have it
3. **Checklist** - Medium value, saves time
4. **Reference card** - Medium-high value, ongoing utility
5. **Templates** - High value, ready to use
6. **Code/Scripts** - High value, hours saved
7. **Extended content** - High value if genuinely useful
8. **Video walkthrough** - Highest value, different medium

## Matching Incentive to Content Type

| Post Type      | Primary Incentive      | Secondary Incentive         |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Tutorial       | Implementation Kit     | Checklist                   |
| Concept/Theory | Reference Card         | Extended Examples           |
| Comparison     | Comparison Matrix      | Decision Framework          |
| Case Study     | Template based on case | Similar case studies        |
| Opinion/Take   | Extended reasoning     | Counter-arguments addressed |
| How We Built X | Architecture diagrams  | Code samples                |

## Content Stripping Guidelines

**Good candidates for removal**:

- Appendices and deep dives
- Multiple examples when one suffices
- Reference tables and matrices
- Code for multiple platforms (keep one, gate others)
- "Advanced" or "Production" sections

**Keep in post**:

- Core concept explanation
- At least one complete example
- Enough to be useful standalone
- Problem statement and motivation

**Rule**: The post must remain valuable without the gated content. Stripping should feel like "bonus" not "ransom."

## Placement Strategy

### Mid-post CTA

- Place after establishing value, before deep dive
- Works for: Reference cards, checklists
- Copy angle: "Want the quick reference version?"

### End-of-post CTA

- Place after delivering full value
- Works for: Implementation kits, extended content
- Copy angle: "Ready to implement? Get the starter kit."

### Multiple CTAs (advanced)

- Different offers at different points
- Mid-post: Quick reference
- End-post: Full implementation bundle
- Track which converts better
