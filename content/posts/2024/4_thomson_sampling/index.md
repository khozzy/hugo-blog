In the world of machine learning and statistics, making decisions under uncertainty is a common challenge. One particularly powerful technique to address this challenge is **Thompson Sampling**. This method is widely used in scenarios where we need to balance _exploration_ (trying new things) and _exploitation_ (leveraging known information). Thompson Sampling finds applications in various domains, from online advertising to dynamic pricing, making it a versatile and valuable tool.

In this blog post, we'll explore the Thompson Sampling technique in depth, using three real-world examples to illustrate its power. We'll also provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement Thompson Sampling in Python, focusing on different prior and posterior distributions suited to each example.

## Examples
### Problem 1 - Online Advertising
> You're running an online ad campaign with multiple versions of an ad. You want to determine which ad version has the highest click-through rate (CTR) by balancing exporation and exploitation.

### Problem 2 - Dynamic Pricing
> Retailers often struggle with pricing decisions. Setting the price too high could reduce sales, while pricing too low could hurt profitability. Thompson Sampling can help in setting dynamic prices by exploring different price points and gradually honing in on the optimal price that maximizes revenue.

### Problem 3 - A/B/n Testing for Website Layouts
> Suppose you're running an A/B test on a website with multiple layout designs, each with different probabilities of leading to user sign-ups. You want to identify the best-performing layout.
